Hey, greetings JetBrains team

I am the newest student in their psychology course, and, although it is a medical science college, the area of ​​technological innovation, AI, Big Data in the health area, and Information Security focused on the health area is well explored at the college.

I, personally, have only been in the world of programming for 6 months, but I had the immense honor of joining such a great institution. My dream is to integrate 90% or more of the technology area with psychology. I am starting a scientific initiation, where I want to research the effects of screens on the development of children and adolescents, and I have a great desire to do this with data analysis and analytical automation. I dream of creating software that can be used in every psychology office, where the professional, together with a well-trained AI, will treat each patient more accurately. I would love the chance to be able to access JetBrains tools so that I can make the world a better place, with more qualified professionals.

The institution itself provides some short courses in technology aimed at the health area, such as:

Bringing transformation to the world begins with courses designed collectively, which have an impact on you, your life experience and the society that surrounds you. After all, innovation is more than training qualified professionals, it is training professionals who have empathy, sensitivity to society's problems and seek to use their own knowledge to grow together with the world. Thus, we achieve a multiple, current path that connects new knowledge and scientific trends to people.
